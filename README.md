## Development

The client application is built using `react`, `typescript` and `webpack` -- any edits you make to the files under 
`/src/` will need to be recompiled using the following command:

    npm run build
    
The server is built using standard Node.js and `express` settings. Simply run the following command to compile the client
application and then fire up the server:

    npm start
    
Then open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
